# BiddingAgents
You will program bidding agents to participate in a generalized second-price (GSP) auction. The first agent you will design uses a balanced bidding strategy. See Equation 10.16 in the reading. 
You will also design an agent to do as well as possible in a competitive environment, and in the presence of daily budget constraints on how much it can spend (see, e.g. the discussion in Section 10.6.2 in the reading). You will also explore the effect that the design of payment rules has on revenue.
