# Bidding Agents
For this assignment, we were asked to program bidding agents to participate in a generalized second-price (GSP) auction. The balanced bidding agent can be found in **angelslavbb.py**.

We also implemented our own version of a budget bidding agent to compete in a tournament against the rest of the class. It can be found in **angelslavbudget.py**.
